                Hello funny people in my screen. I'm a 15 year old digital artist and graphic/UI designer based in Canada. I’ve taken art seriously since 2017, and have been doodling goofy anime characters since 2020. I’ve also done some design work in open-source projects. Recently, however, I’ve grown a knack in programming. Currently learning Python, and JS -> Svelte. Hope to move onto Flutter one day. Don’t look into it though, it’s not even that interesting.
